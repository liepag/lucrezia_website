          <p><strong>Lucrezia Vittoria Chelini</strong> is an Art Practitioner. She specialises in Music Composition, Poetry, Singing and Movement.</p>
          <p>Her experience has been extremely eclectic. She had led a jazz band called “Duendes”, performing around London in various establishments such as ‘Alley Cats’ in Denmark Street. She has performed residencies in the Islington Mill in Manchester and the Siobhan Davies Dance Studios in London where she has been researching her practice. She has also participated in a commission for the Beaconsfield Gallery in Vauxhall, where she performed her original work entitled The Heart Beating.</p>
          <p>Lucrezia recently graduated from the BA Performance and Creative Enterprise programme at  Guildhall School of Music & Drama. Her time as a student there was filled with many enriching experiences, such as the creative work in communities - in particular The Green Candle Association with The Half Moon Theatre - and she has performed her original work The Dawn of a Light in the Milton Court Studio Theatre in Barbican, London, for her final performance.</p>
          <p>Through her work, Lucrezia aims to reach a variety of contrasting audiences and connect them with her thoughts and feelings of life and art. She believes in working with unconventional art styles that have influenced various practitioners to create art through contact with nature, improvisation and soundscape work.</p>
          <p>She is determined to create an orchestral band formed by piano, violin, clarinet, double bass and synthesizers, where she will perform original songs, spoken poetry and physical theatre.<p>
